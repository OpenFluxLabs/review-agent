2. Simulation mode for testing
3. Instructions for setting up voice recording

        üé§ Setting up Voice Input:
        
        For real voice recording, you can:
        
        1. **Use OpenAI Whisper API** (Easiest):
           - Add OPENAI_API_KEY to your .env file
           - Record audio with any app, save as .mp3/.wav
           - Use the process_audio_file() function
        
        2. **Install local dependencies**:
           ```bash
           # On Ubuntu/Debian:
           sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
           pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
           
           # On macOS:
           brew install portaudio
           pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
           
           # On Windows:
           pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
           ```
        
        3. **Use phone recording**:
           - Record voice memo on your phone
           - Transfer to computer
           - Process with process_audio_file()
        
        4. **Online tools**:
           - Use online speech-to-text tools
           - Copy/paste the result
